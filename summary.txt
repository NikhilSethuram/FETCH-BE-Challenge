1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?

I chose Python with Flask for its simplicity and quick setup for REST APIs. Flask is lightweight yet powerful, 
making it ideal for this exercise. Python's built-in libraries, like datetime for timestamp handling and jsonify 
for JSON responses, ensure concise and readable code while efficiently meeting the problem's requirements

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?

The solution is straightforward and easy to understand, using Python and Flask for quick development.
In-memory data structures allow for fast access and manipulation of data without database overhead.

The only disadvantage is the lack of persistent storage means all data is lost if the server restarts.
Additionally, the solution may not handle concurrent requests well and isn't scalable for multiple users or large datasets due to its
in-memory nature.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?

https://enrollbadge.com/

One of my greatest accomplishments was the impact my application enRollBadge had on my school and just overall the whole project. 
enRollBadge is a web application I created to notify students at our large public school when classes are open or waitlisted as it
is a common problem, which was motivated by students we saw struggling around us. Not only did the project test my leadership skills as 
I led a team of 4 developers in different parts of the world, but it also tested my technical skills as it was something that had never
been done before on an old system that was extremely difficult to navigate with no documentation. 
This was also my first entrepreneurial experience and I am very glad I was able to lead the company to success.
Now, enRollBadge helps hundreds of students on campus get the classes they want when they need it and it always puts a smile on my face
to see how it has changed the process of enrollment in real time.
